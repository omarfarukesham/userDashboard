 - [@Merchant-app link](https://toolmarchent.web.app/)

This is  an User Dashboard, a mini MERN stack project, three main features are aviable in this app. First of all - userData showing in UI, Secondly - data has segregration by user Country, Gender, Device etc. Thirdly, some data analysis has present by the react chartJs, Finally another Customized user information specially userAdded, userUpdated, userDelete by the Dashboard user. This app has free hosting with Heroku server for NodeJs, Netlify for the ReactJs UI. Due to some free hosting it might be not optimum speed, so please if needed some time loading just one refresh which will be helpful for UI visibility.

## FAQ

#### Q-01:  Can I use this app in commercial purpose ?

 Answer: No, this app only for development purpose, to promote market, certainly you
need to ensure some production technology, like payment getway. I am using this technology for developer api key, where you need, primenum key.
